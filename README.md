# Pokedex

Pokemon is cult classic video game introduced in the 1990s. In these games, there are different creatures, called pokemon, that a player can catch, collect, train, and battle with. Each of these pokemon have different names, weights, heights, attack/defenses, abilities, etc. Because of this complexity, there is a lot of information surrounding each pokemon, and all that data needs to be kept track of somewhere. The in-game solution to store this data is the pokedex.

In this project, the program is given a csv file filled with all the information you could ever dream of for every pokemon. However, it is filled with data you might never need, and since it is just a file, it can be a pain to get information from. Using that data, the program creates a pokedex for the user to interact with. On startup, the user is provided an interactive menu in which they can enter various options to gather information, presented to them in a clean, human-readable format.
